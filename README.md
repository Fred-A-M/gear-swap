## Description

Music creators often face creative blocks, feeling they need new equipment to create what they envision. For those with limited disposable income, this can lead to long periods of stagnation.

It helps build a contact list of like-minded creators interested in trading gear.

- **Wish List:** Users can list items they're looking to borrow or trade for on a short-term basis.
- **Equipment Swaps:** Connect with other users who are interested in swapping music equipment on a temporary basis, without the need for permanent trades or sales.
